1.) Linear Regression on the SKLEARN Boston Housing Toy Dataset
-The goal / reported parameter is the factor having the largest (positive or negative) impact on housing prices

2.) KMeans Clustering on the SKLEARN Wine Dataset
-The goal / reported parameter is the inferred number of wine classes, determined visually using an Elbow Heuristic Plot
-The Y axis on this plot is the sum of squared distances between sample points and their closest center.
